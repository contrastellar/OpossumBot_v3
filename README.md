# OpossumBot (now in v3!)

OpossumBot v3 is a python module and bot core for posting funny Virginia Opossum (Didelphis virginiana) pictures to your [Discord App](https://discord.com) chats. Converted from `node.js` and brought to life using Python 3.11!

# Info

`opossumbot` is a implementation of `discord.py` and basic `postgresql` queries, to post pictures of Opossums to discord chats!

# Runtime 

OpossumBot (will be) running aboard a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet.
